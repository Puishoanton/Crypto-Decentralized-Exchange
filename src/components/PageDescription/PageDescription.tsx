      A crypto DEX, or decentralized exchange, is a peer-to-peer marketplace for trading
      cryptocurrencies. Unlike traditional exchanges, DEXs operate on a decentralized network, which
      means that they are not controlled by a single entity. They offer users greater privacy,
      security, and control over their assets, making them a popular choice for cryptocurrency
      traders and investors.
